# OOP in C

Somebody challenged me to do csomething that looks like OOP in C

The exercise was : do a base class Shape, with a function "getArea" and a variable Multiplier, and two children classes : Circle and Square which both respectively have radius and side leght as members

Then use getArea from a shape pointer on both types

I don't do C often, the code is ugly, you don't want to look at that lol
